Cluster

I have a **head node** that manages the cluster. Also it will be connected to a set of **worker nodes** that will execute workloads for us.

Envoirenment
---

I can use a tool pyenv-win (windows) to easily download and switch between Python version. Recomended python version is 3.10

```
pip install pyenv-win
pyenv install 3.10.11
pyenv global 3.10.11
```

Create a virtual envoirenment to install our dependencies.

```
mkdir makewithml
cd makewithml
python3 -m venv venv  # create virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

1 CPU --> Head node
Remainin nodes --> Worker nodes
